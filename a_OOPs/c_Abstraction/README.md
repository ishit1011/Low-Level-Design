ðŸ“Œ What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is the concept of hiding implementation details and only exposing essential features to the user.
In real-world systems, users donâ€™t need to know how something works internallyâ€”just how to use it.

ðŸ’¡ Real-World Example in Delivery System:
When you order a package online, you only interact with a tracking system that shows your delivery status.

You donâ€™t see the internal logistics, route planning, or package handling.

You only see what is necessary: the status updates, delivery ETA, and tracking.
