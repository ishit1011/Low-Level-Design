Encapsulation in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

📌 What is Encapsulation?

Encapsulation is the wrapping up of data and functions that operate on the data into a single unit. It is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and ensures that data is hidden from unauthorized access and only accessible through defined methods.

🔹 Encapsulation in OOP:

Encapsulation in programming is implemented using:

Private Data Members: Data that cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.

Public/Protected Methods: Functions that provide controlled access to private data.

Getters & Setters: Special methods to access and modify private data safely.

💡 Real-Life Example: Encapsulation in a Company

Consider a company with different sections, such as Finance, Sales, and Accounts.

The Finance section handles all financial transactions and records financial data.

The Sales section manages sales activities and keeps sales records.

The Accounts section deals with employee salary and tax calculations.

Each section is encapsulated, meaning:
✅ Only Finance can handle financial transactions. 🏦✅ Only Sales can process sales-related activities. 📈✅ Other sections cannot directly modify the data of another section. 🔒

This is exactly how Encapsulation in OOP works!
